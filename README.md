# Space Station Builder

## Description

City Builder style game, but a space station orbiting a planet distantly. Very isolated, as a pose to a lot of space city builder games which tend to be on planets. Not too futuristic. No laser guns, etc. More like 100 years in the future (before The Expanse).

## Ideas

- 2D (Top down almost like prison architect) vs 3D (More like a minecraft / Subnautica kinda first person?)
- Realistic. Not just big laser guns, and SciFi sort of stuff. More like NASA Space Station, waiting for Supply Drop. Re-using and re-cycling water, food, etc
- Building rooms, but also detail within them (e.g. machines, computers, sleeping pods, etc.)
- Very isolated feel. Nothing around appart from the planet in the distance that your orbiting.
- Maybe a cut of sort of feel (i.e. Survival), but main focus on base building. OR completely void of that and just at a great distance waiting for supply drops / new crew etc.
- Should you be a person in the base, or be controlling the base and all the people?
